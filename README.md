# 👋 Hey, I'm Chester

I'm a CS student at Folsom Lake College, planning to transfer to UC Berkeley.  
Right now, I'm doing research at UC Davis (world models, robotics, that kind of stuff)  
and playing around with LLMs and prompt engineering over at Algoverse AI.

---

## 🛠️ Stuff I'm Working On
- 🤖 Sim-to-real world modeling for robotics (UC Davis LARA Lab)
- 🧠 Playing with LLM reasoning in latent space (Algoverse)
---

## 📚 Things I'm Learning
- Go, C++, and systems/backend engineering
- Deep learning theory and how models actually think
- Quant finance and all the math behind it
